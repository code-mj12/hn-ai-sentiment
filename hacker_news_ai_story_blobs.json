    "story_text_clean": "Companies building software in the US were hit hard a few years ago when the tax code stopped allowing deduction of software dev expenses.

    "comment_text_blob": "A lot of people don't know what this Section 174 is about, so here's a brief explainer. Normally, when you have expenses, you deduct them off your revenue to find your taxable profit. If you have $1 million in sales, and $900k in costs, you have $100k in profit, and the government taxes you on that profit. Section 174 says you can't do this for software engineers. If you pay a software engineer, that's not \"really\" an \"expense\", regardless of the fact that you paid them. What you've actually done, Congress said, is bought a capital good, like a machine. And for calculating tax owed, you have to depreciate that over several years (5 in this case). Depreciating means that if you pay an engineer $200k in a year, in tax-world you only had $40k of real expense that year, even though you paid them $200k. So the effect is that it makes engineers much more expensive, because normally when a company hires an engineer, like they spend on any other expense, they can at least think \"well, they will reduce our profit, which reduces our tax obligation,\" but in this case software engineers are special and aren't deductible in the same way. In the case of the $200k engineer, you deduct the first $40k in the first year, then you can expense another $40k from that first year in the second year, the third $40k in the third year, and so on through the fifth year. So eventually you get to expense the entire first year of the engineer's pay, but only after five years. The effect is that companies wind up using their scarce capital to loan the federal government money for five years, and so engineers become a heavy financial burden. If a company hires too many engineers, they will owe the federal government income tax even in years in which they were unprofitable. These rules, by the way, don't apply to other personnel costs. If you hire an HR person or a corporate executive, you expense them in the year you paid them. It's a special rule for software engineers. It was passed by Congress during the first Trump administration in order to offset the costs of other corporate tax rate cuts, due to budgeting rules. I think people are missing the actual process used by Finance teams relating to this issue. I am a former CFO and spent a fair amount of time with this issue in my last role. The firm had a significant amount of software engineering expense related to its core operating system that was the backbone of the company. The FASB accounting rules drive the capitalization of software expenses, not the tax rules. The FASB definition of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principals) for US firms is very specific and requires significant detailed tracking to comply. As noted in one of the other posts, many companies want to capitalize as much software engineering expense as possible as that leads to higher operating income and net income. Bonuses, option grants and stock prices tend to be tied to those metrics. The argument is that building a piece of software should be treated like purchasing it off the shelf. If a firm pays $1M to implement SAP, it does not have to expense it all in one year, but rather depreciates it over its \u201cexpected life.\u201d Since \u201cexpected life\u201d is difficult to define for every piece of software, there are default lifetimes (similar to saying motor vehicles default to a 5 year depreciation schedule). Tax then generally follows the GAAP accounting except when the government intervenes to try and increase capital spending. Periodically the government will allow accelerated depreciation which increases operating expenses for tax purposes only which reduces current period cash taxes. Note total taxes do not change, only when they get paid. The Section 174 under discussion here is simply the same idea then applied to software development in an effort to juice hiring. For the people discussing whether the IRS is effectively tracking and enforcing this - the IRS really does not matter. A companies auditors enforce it. Without all of the necessary paperwork/digital audit trail, a firm in not permitted by the auditors to capitalize the expense. The same auditors have to sign off on the tax treatment as well. Finally, with respect to maintenance, the idea is meant to be similar to the treatment for machinery ( i.e. traditional capital expenditures). When a firm puts gas in the company truck or replaces tires or fixes a windshield, they do not capitalize those expenses. The idea is the expense do not fundamentally improve the item or meaningful extend the life beyond the initial expectations. Following that line of thought, maintenance releases are not thought to extend the life of the software while significant improvements to the software do and therefore can be capitalized. DISCLAIMER - while I was a CFO, I was not a Certified Accountant. What I have described above is what the accountants and my audit firms described to me as I worked through this issue in preparing financial statements. The Small Software Business Alliance has been actively working on this issue since day one. https://ssballiance.org/about/engage/ And Michelle Hansen was an early organizer https://x.com/mjwhansen If you work at all in energy, the Clean Energy Business Network is also proactive in fighting for change. A couple of years ago they put me touch with Ron Wyden's staff. The Democrats are almost universally opposed to what was added to Section 174. https://www.cebn.org/media_resources/house-republicans-advan... Fight this thing - it is terrible. Not just for software but any innovative business in the USA. Thank you for helping to tackle this. The silence on this issue for the past few years from smaller software companies and their affiliates was surprising to me. The recent \"time bomb\" article was one of the few media pieces that actually took the time to describe it as anything other than a \"tax cut for huge tech companies\", which was refreshing. My current favorite theory as to why there hasn't been more of an outcry is that many companies ignored the rule change (either out of ignorance or as an alternative to going out of business), and are forced to remain silent. Thanks for working on this guys. The current tax code is fairly crazy: you could spend a few million in salaries, sell 200k of software in a year and possibly owe taxes on that. Even if the company would otherwise be shutting down. The traditional capital asset treatment applied to software leaves a lot to be desired. Some software is a capital asset, but much just isn\u2019t. Or at least should be considered to depreciate rapidly.",

Naturally, people thought this was a new policy. So they asked support. And here\u2019s where it gets batshit: Cursor has a support email, so users emailed them to find out. The support peson told everyone this was \u201cexpected behavior\u201d under their new login policy. One problem. There was no support team, it was an AI designed to 'mimic human responses' That answer, totally made up by the bot, spread like wildfire. Users assumed it was real (because why wouldn\u2019t they? It's their own support system lol), and within hours the community was in revolt. Dozens of users publicly canceled their subscriptions, myself included.

And just as people started comparing notes and figuring out that the story didn\u2019t quite add up\u2026 the main Reddit thread got locked. Then deleted.

To be clear: this wasn\u2019t an actual policy change, just a backend session bug, and a hallucinated excuse from a support bot that somehow did more damage than the bug itself.
