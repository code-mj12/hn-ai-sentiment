{"id": 44226571, "root_story_id": 44226145, "node_type": "comment", "comment_depth": 1, "text": "A lot of people don't know what this Section 174 is about, so here's a brief explainer. Normally, when you have expenses, you deduct them off your revenue to find your taxable profit. If you have $1 million in sales, and $900k in costs, you have $100k in profit, and the government taxes you on that profit. Section 174 says you can't do this for software engineers. If you pay a software engineer, that's not \"really\" an \"expense\", regardless of the fact that you paid them. What you've actually done, Congress said, is bought a capital good, like a machine. And for calculating tax owed, you have to depreciate that over several years (5 in this case). Depreciating means that if you pay an engineer $200k in a year, in tax-world you only had $40k of real expense that year, even though you paid them $200k. So the effect is that it makes engineers much more expensive, because normally when a company hires an engineer, like they spend on any other expense, they can at least think \"well, they will reduce our profit, which reduces our tax obligation,\" but in this case software engineers are special and aren't deductible in the same way. In the case of the $200k engineer, you deduct the first $40k in the first year, then you can expense another $40k from that first year in the second year, the third $40k in the third year, and so on through the fifth year. So eventually you get to expense the entire first year of the engineer's pay, but only after five years. The effect is that companies wind up using their scarce capital to loan the federal government money for five years, and so engineers become a heavy financial burden. If a company hires too many engineers, they will owe the federal government income tax even in years in which they were unprofitable. These rules, by the way, don't apply to other personnel costs. If you hire an HR person or a corporate executive, you expense them in the year you paid them. It's a special rule for software engineers. It was passed by Congress during the first Trump administration in order to offset the costs of other corporate tax rate cuts, due to budgeting rules.", "normalized_text": "a lot of people don t know what this section 174 is about so here s a brief explainer normally when you have expenses you deduct them off your revenue to find your taxable profit if you have 1 million in sales and 900k in costs you have 100k in profit and the government taxes you on that profit section 174 says you can t do this for software engineers if you pay a software engineer that s not really an expense regardless of the fact that you paid them what you ve actually done congress said is bought a capital good like a machine and for calculating tax owed you have to depreciate that over several years 5 in this case depreciating means that if you pay an engineer 200k in a year in tax world you only had 40k of real expense that year even though you paid them 200k so the effect is that it makes engineers much more expensive because normally when a company hires an engineer like they spend on any other expense they can at least think well they will reduce our profit which reduces our tax obligation but in this case software engineers are special and aren t deductible in the same way in the case of the 200k engineer you deduct the first 40k in the first year then you can expense another 40k from that first year in the second year the third 40k in the third year and so on through the fifth year so eventually you get to expense the entire first year of the engineer s pay but only after five years the effect is that companies wind up using their scarce capital to loan the federal government money for five years and so engineers become a heavy financial burden if a company hires too many engineers they will owe the federal government income tax even in years in which they were unprofitable these rules by the way don t apply to other personnel costs if you hire an hr person or a corporate executive you expense them in the year you paid them it s a special rule for software engineers it was passed by congress during the first trump administration in order to offset the costs of other corporate tax rate cuts due to budgeting rules", "model_tags": [], "aspect_hints": ["cost_price", "regulation_policy", "business_model"], "context": {"root_title": "Tell HN: Help restore the tax deduction for software dev in the US (Section 174)", "root_author": "dang", "root_url": "", "root_text": "Companies building software in the US were hit hard a few years ago when the tax code stopped allowing deduction of software dev expenses.

I am a former CFO and spent a fair amount of time with this issue in my last role. The firm had a significant amount of software engineering expense related to its core operating system that was the backbone of the company. The FASB accounting rules drive the capitalization of software expenses, not the tax rules. The FASB definition of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principals) for US firms is very specific and requires significant detailed tracking to comply. As noted in one of the other posts, many companies want to capitalize as much software engineering expense as possible as that leads to higher operating income and net income. Bonuses, option grants and stock prices tend to be tied to those metrics. The argument is that building a piece of software should be treated like purchasing it off the shelf. If a firm pays $1M to implement SAP, it does not have to expense it all in one year, but rather depreciates it over its “expected life.” Since “expected life” is difficult to define for every piece of software, there are default lifetimes (similar to saying motor vehicles default to a 5 year depreciation schedule). Tax then generally follows the GAAP accounting except when the government intervenes to try and increase capital spending. Periodically the government will allow accelerated depreciation which increases operating expenses for tax purposes only which reduces current period cash taxes. Note total taxes do not change, only when they get paid. The Section 174 under discussion here is simply the same idea then applied to software development in an effort to juice hiring. For the people discussing whether the IRS is effectively tracking and enforcing this - the IRS really does not matter. A companies auditors enforce it. Without all of the necessary paperwork/digital audit trail, a firm in not permitted by the auditors to capitalize the expense. The same auditors have to sign off on the tax treatment as well. Finally, with respect to maintenance, the idea is meant to be similar to the treatment for machinery ( i.e. traditional capital expenditures). When a firm puts gas in the company truck or replaces tires or fixes a windshield, they do not capitalize those expenses. The idea is the expense do not fundamentally improve the item or meaningful extend the life beyond the initial expectations. Following that line of thought, maintenance releases are not thought to extend the life of the software while significant improvements to the software do and therefore can be capitalized. DISCLAIMER - while I was a CFO, I was not a Certified Accountant.
