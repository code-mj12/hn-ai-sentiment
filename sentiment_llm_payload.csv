40346978,40345775,comment,1,"Very interesting and extremely impressive! I tried using the voice chat in their app previously and was disappointed. The big UX problem was that it didn't try to understand when I had finished speaking. English is a second language and I paused a bit too long thinking of a word and it just started responding to my obviously half spoken sentence. Trying again it just became stressful as I had to rush my words out to avoid an annoying response to an unfinished thought. I didn't try interrupting it but judging by the comments here it was not possible. It was very surprising to me to be so overtly exposed to the nuances of real conversation. Just this one thing of not understanding when it's your turn to talk made the interaction very unpleasant, more than I would have expected. On that note, I noticed that the AI in the demo seems to be very rambly. It almost always just kept talking and many statements were reiterations of previous ones. It reminded me of a type of youtuber that uses a lot of filler phrases like ""let's go ahead and ..."", just to be more verbose and lessen silences. Most of the statements by the guy doing the demo were interrupting the AI. It's still extremely impressive but I found this interesting enough to share.

This also has the important effect of neutralizing the critique of US Government AI regulation because it will democratize ""frontier"" models and make enforcement nearly impossible. Thank you, Zuck, this is an important and historic move. It also opens up the market to a lot more entry in the area of ""ancillary services to support the effective use of frontier models"" (including safety-oriented concerns), which should really be the larger market segment.",this is really good news zuck sees the inevitability of it and the dystopian regulatory landscape and decided to go all in this also has the important effect of neutralizing the critique of us government ai regulation because it will democratize frontier models and make enforcement nearly impossible thank you zuck this is an important and historic move it also opens up the market to a lot more entry in the area of ancillary services to support the effective use of frontier models including safety oriented concerns which should really be the larger market segment,[],"['cost_price', 'regulation_policy', 'business_model']","{'root_title': 'Open source AI is the path forward', 'root_author': 'atgctg', 'root_url': 'https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/', 'node_author': 'resters', 'node_time': '2024-07-23T16:17:28+00:00'}","You are an expert analyst.

41048452,41046773,comment,1,"> Third, a key difference between Meta and closed model providers is that selling access to AI models isn’t our business model. That means openly releasing Llama doesn’t undercut our revenue, sustainability, or ability to invest in research like it does for closed providers. (This is one reason several closed providers consistently lobby governments against open source.) The whole thing is interesting, but this part strikes me as potentially anticompetitive reasoning.
